## 🌐 Overview

Epoch Drops is a multi-component ecosystem built to collect, analyze, and display mob drop and quest reward data from World of Warcraft (3.3.5a), focused specifically on the **Epoch** server.

This project helps players discover where to find items, how often they drop, and what quests reward them.

## 🧩 Project Structure

### 🧙‍♂️ Addon: `Epoch_Drops`

A lightweight WoW addon written in Lua that:

- Tracks item drops from mobs and quest rewards.
- Serializes collected data into a JSON-encoded Lua string.
- Stores data in the `SavedVariables` file for the tray app to access.

### 🖥️ Tray App: `EpochDropsUploader`

A Windows-only tray application built with C# WinForms that:

- Runs silently in the background from the system tray.
- Watches all relevant `SavedVariables` folders for the `Epoch_Drops.lua` file.
- Validates that the addon is collecting from the correct realm.
- Extracts and parses JSON data from the Lua file.
- Uploads data securely to the backend API using a secret upload key.
- Renames uploaded files to prevent duplicates.

### 🛠️ API Backend: `EpochDropsAPI`

A fast and minimal REST API built with **ASP.NET Core Minimal API**:

- Accepts uploads of parsed addon data (`/upload`).
- Provides endpoints for:
  - Items by ID, category, and subtype.
  - Mobs by ID.
  - Quests and their associated rewards.
  - Quick search.
- Stores all data in **PostgreSQL**.
- Handles CORS for the frontend.
- Automatically applies database migrations at startup.
- Docker-ready and deployed via Railway.

### 🌍 Web App: `epoch-drops.com`

A modern web frontend built with **Next.js App Router**:

- Displays a searchable, categorized list of all items.
- Shows item detail pages with:
  - Drop rate data based on uploads.
  - Quest reward associations.
- Includes mob and quest detail pages.
- Fully responsive and hosted on **Vercel**.
- Connects to the API for real-time data.
